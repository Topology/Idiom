\section{Core Definitions}

\nl A \defcon{visual field} is multidimensional space of location and color occurring at each location. 

\nl There exist a color occuring within a visual field called the \defcon{background color}.

\nl A \defcon{symbol} or \defcon{character} is a small region of space within the visual field which contains a pattern of color.  

\nl If the color of the symbol does not contrast with the background color of the containing space, the symbol is called a \defcon{whitespace character}.  

\nl Given symbols $a_1, \dots, a_n$, A sequence of symbols $\seq{a_1\dots a_n}$ in the visual field is called a \defcon{string}.

\nl A string which contains no whitespace characters is called an \defcon{atomic string}.

\nl Given a string $S_1= \seq{a_1\dots a_n}$ and a string $S_2 = \seq{b_1\dots b_m}$, the string $S_1\seqcat S_2 = \seq{a_1\dots a_nb_1\dots b_m}$ is called the \defcon{concatenation of $S_1$ and $S_2$}.

\nl Given a string $S$ containing whitespace characters, a sequence of atomic strings $\seq{T_1,\dots, T_n}$ is called the \defcon{sequence of atomic strings in $S$} when the string resulting from removing the whitespace characters from $S$ is the same string as $T_1\seqcat T_2\seqcat\dots \seqcat T_n$.

\nl A set of symbols or characters is called an \defcon{Alphabet}.

\nl A string occupies a fixed amount of space and contains a pattern of color and is itself a \defcon{symbol}.

\nl A set of strings is an \defcon {alphabet}.

\nl Given an alphabet $A$, a sequence of symbols $\seq{a_1a_2\dots a_n}$  is called a \defcon{string from alphabet $A$}  when  $a_i\in A$ for $i\in[1..n]$.

\nl Given an alphabet $A$, a set of strings from alphabet $A$ is called a \defcon{language over alphabet $A$}.
