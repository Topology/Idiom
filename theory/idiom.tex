\section{Core Definitions}

\nl The concept of a \defcon{symbol} is taken as a primitive concept within a visual field.  It is an entity which occupies a fixed amount of space and which contains a pattern of color.  

\nl A sequence of symbols in the visual field is called a \defcon{string}.

\nl A set of symbols is called an \defcon{Alphabet}.

\nl Given an alphabet $A$, a sequence of symbols $\seq{a_1a_2\dots a_n}$  is called a \defcon{string from alphabet $A$}  when  $a_i\in A$ for $i\in[1..n]$.

\nl Symbols which occupy space but do not cause a color contrast with the background color of the visual field are called \defcon{whitespace symbols}.

\nl A string which contains no whitespace characters is called a \defcon{terminal}.
